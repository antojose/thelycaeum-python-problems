        a. Write a function that will print the times tables for a given
           number from 1 to 10.
           Sample output:
           tables(4) should display
            1 x 4 =  4
            2 x 4 =  8
            3 x 4 = 12
            4 x 4 = 16
            5 x 4 = 20
            6 x 4 = 24
            7 x 4 = 28
            8 x 4 = 32
            9 x 4 = 36
           10 x 4 = 40

        b. Write a function called fizzbizz that will print numbers from
           1 to 100. For multiples of 3, it should print "fizz", for
           multiples of 5, it should print "bizz" and for multiples of
           15, it should print "fizzbizz".
           Sample Output:
           fizzbizz() should display
           1
           2
           fizz
           4
           bizz
           fizz
           7
           8
           fizz
           bizz
           11
           fizz
           13
           14
           fizzbizz
           16
           17
           .
           .
           .
           .
        c. Write a python function to check whether a given string is a
           palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same from
           left to right and from right to left.
           Sample Output:
           palindrome("malayalam") should return True
           palindrome("angel")     should return False
           palindrome("")          should return True
           palindrome("madam")     should return True

        d. Write a python function to check whether a given sentence
           contains all letters of the alphabet.
           Sample output:
           panagram("sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow") should return True
           panagram("red bulb, blue bulb")  should return False

        e. Write a program to print the number of times each letter
           occurs in a given string.
           Sample output:
           freq("she sells sea shells on the sea shore") should print
             a :: 2
               :: 7
             e :: 7
             h :: 4
             l :: 4
             o :: 2
             n :: 1
             s :: 8
             r :: 1
             t :: 1
           This means that there are 2 a's, 8 s's etc.

        f. Write a function that will calculate the prime numbers
           between 2 and a given number.
           Sample output:
           primes(50) should return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]

           To do this, you have to use the algorith called Sieve of
           Erathosthenes. You can look at the wikipedia entry for this
           algorithm. Don't look for anything else. Don't use the modulo
           operator (%) in your program.
